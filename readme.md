This bash script 

1. checks for nextcloud desktop appimage updates,
2. downloads the latest appimage if available,
3. runs the latest version.

Put it where you keep the nextcloud dektop clients appimages 
(usually ~/Downloads) and run it on each startup, e.g. by putting 

~/Downloads/runnc.sh

as a "startup applications preferences" command.
