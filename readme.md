This bash script 

1. checks for nextcloud desktop appimage updates,
2. downloads the latest appimage if an update is available,
3. runs the latest version.

Put it where you keep the nextcloud dektop clients appimages 
(usually ~/Downloads), make it executable `chmod +x runnc.sh` 
and run it on each startup automatically.
